Building this RAG chatbot was a valuable hands-on experience in designing
a real-world retrieval-augmented generation system. The most challenging
part of the project was retrieval quality, particularly handling noise
from introductory content and sparse concepts like named techniques.
This required careful evaluation of vector-only retrieval and justified
the transition to a hybrid retrieval approach combining semantic and
keyword-based search.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how RAG systems
behave in practice, especially the trade-offs between correctness,
latency, and complexity. I also learned the importance of modular pipeline
design, reproducibility, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. This experience
reinforced that building reliable RAG systems is less about prompting and
more about data preparation, retrieval strategy, and evaluation.
