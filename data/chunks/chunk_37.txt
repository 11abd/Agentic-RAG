see that any embedding model or embedding system can provide 100% of the accuracy because still LLM or like similarity search can be like mistaken mistaken interpreter and one of the like best results that you can find like on the Google website for example it's research about the legal discovery so they put 1.4 million of different low documents with utilization of Gemini embedding and they achieve 87% accuracy and it's like for sure quite good number and with another like application mind lid they achieved 82% of three top results recall in terms of the matrix it's as well quite good result and in which what is good with the direction of embedding models and we discussed a bit when we discuss about chunking strategies that's when you utilize like additional ML or Genie or embedding models it's additional time for indexing and it's additional time for the compute so it's much slower Gemini embedding already showing like quite good results in terms of the speed so they tried to vectorize 100 emails on one of the study and they achieved 21 and half seconds for vectorization of all of that emails and just to give you perspective of how it fast and what is the how fast we are moving to improving all of these tools and systems the previous result was more than 200 seconds so the order of magnitude in terms of the speed increase for the vectorization in 10 times so that system much
