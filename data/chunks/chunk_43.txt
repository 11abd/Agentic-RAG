is not enough. main players for the graph rock solutions so now for Jay, Falcon, Tiger, Graph, Mamm Graph and ArangoDB mainly we are playing like with the now for Jay because you can easily like install it on the York laptop and I guess it's one of the most popular solution I would say. the next problem that's quite often come in the PDF processing problem so in the PDF we can have images in the PDF we can have tables and maybe some formulas so it's quiet complex documents to parse for the LLM and in the traditional rock pipelines we have like OCR objects so basically the ML system or it can be like LLM that can look exactly on the PDF and then provide in the text in the text view describe what it sees on the PDF and then we can just like vectorize it quite easily. still we have like issues with the tables quite often and here like some OCR again can help some other approaches, captions so instead of like using complex trivial system and that's relying on OCR because they quite often like failing with that we can just use some embedding model that can understand what it sees so just embed the image and one of the interesting approach to solve this question for the last time it's quite like you let's say approach it's called poly library changes so they instead of like using OCR just for the describing
