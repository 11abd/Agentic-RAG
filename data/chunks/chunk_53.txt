the most the approaches like some another LLN utilized if you are not utilizing the people to to prepare the data so it's still not finalized question even for in general for the AI industry I would say --- pdf_text.txt --- --- Databases for GenAI.pdf --- 1 Place for photo Databases for GenAI Embeddings, Vector Databases & Production Patterns October 2025 2 Speaker Maksym Lypivskyi Head of Cloud Platforms & AI Director ● 9 years at Ciklum driving large-scale cloud and software delivery initiatives ● 3 years specializing in AI ● Core interest: making AI systems reliable, production-ready, and business-impactful 3 Agenda 01 02 03 Foundations Advanced RAG patterns Production readiness 4 Foundations 5 What Are Embeddings? The Problem: Computers don't understand text meaning "machine learning algorithms" "ML techniques" "deep neural networks" Are these similar? How do we compute that? 6 How Similarity Search Works The Vector Search Process Documents → Embedding Model → Store vectors Doc 1: "Python tutorial" → [0.2, -0.4, 0.6, ...] → Store Doc 2: "Java programming" → [0.3, -0.5, 0.5, ...] → Store Doc 3: "Cooking recipes" → [-0.8, 0.9, -0.2, ...] → Store 1. INDEXING 2. SEARCHING User Query: "learn Python" → [0.21, -0.42, 0.58, ...] Compute distances to ALL stored vectors: - Distance to Doc 1: 0.03 ✓ (very close!) - Distance to Doc 2: 0.15 (somewhat close) - Distance to Doc 3: 0.91 (far away) Similarity Metrics - Cosine similarity: Angle between vectors (most common) - Euclidean distance: Straight-line distance - Dot
