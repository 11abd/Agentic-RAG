on this exactly like image we have 500 36 dimensions so it's basically like graphs with the different points and in the dimension of this size we are we are putting the representation of this work on that graph. The same like for the ML algorithms, pizza and stuff like that. And if we are asking like about like machine learning for example then computer based on that vector representation and number representation can understand if like machine learning for example because we already transformed the representation into the numbers if it's close to some of the like information that we have right now in the vector system or it's far. So based on like close and far it's basically like vector databases when we set up like choose top five results providing to us with the answer from the five closest objects and then transform this to the text and we are basically getting that's that's text that's most closest to to the text from our request. In this case like for the machine learning ML algorithms is quite close because the distance 0.02 and if we just want to get only one like top element then we are getting ML algorithms. Pizza recipes is quite far so most probably system will not suggest this to us. And if we are going a bit like deeper to the exact like similarity search how it works. So we have our documents we already discussed about the rock pipeline so it's
