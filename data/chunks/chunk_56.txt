12 GraphRAG Solution 13 13 The PDF Processing Problem 🆇 OCR → Errors with complex layouts 🆇 Layout detection → Misses table structures 🆇 Figure captioning → Expensive specialized models 🆇 Chunking → Loses visual context 🆇 Embed text only → No visual information Traditional RAG Pipeline for PDFs Result: 40-60% information loss on visual documents 14 14 ColPali Revolution Treat Pages as Images (No OCR!) Architecture ● PaliGemma-3B Vision Language Model ● 32×32 patches = 1,024 patch embeddings per page ● ColBERT late interaction matching 15 15 What Makes RAG "Agentic" 16 16 Agentic Patterns Query Decomposition Complex: "Compare our Q3 to industry and predict Q4" Agent breaks down: ● "Our Q3 metrics" → Internal DB ● "Industry Q3 benchmarks" → Web Search ● "Q4 factors" → Internal DB Then synthesizes all results Self-Correction 1. Retrieval 2. Grade docs 3. Score < threshold? 4. Rewrite query 5. Retry 6. Grade again Query Routing User: "What's the latest on AI regulation?" Router: "latest" detected → Route to Web Search ✓ User: "What's our Q3 marketing budget?" Router: "our" = internal → Route to Vector DB ✓ ✅ Use When: Queries span sources, complexity varies 🆇 Don't Use: Latency-critical (<500ms SLA), simple retrieval 17 17 Hybrid Search + Reranking Power Vector-only: Misses exact matches, acronyms BM25-only: No semantic understanding Anthropic Contextual Retrieval Study: - Baseline failure rate: 5.7% - Hybrid + Reranker: 1.9% - 67% reduction in retrieval failures 2 Stage Architecture Rerank: Stage 1: Similarity search → Top 100 Stage
