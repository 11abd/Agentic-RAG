I will try to finish this like in five minutes and then we will have five minutes for for the questions I just will not stop quite deeply on each of the slide just few words and what is the information important from that in addition to increase the quality of our rock systems and why I mentioned earlier that you shouldn't rely only on the vector search in addition you
