Rerank: Stage 1: Similarity search → Top 100 Stage 2: Re-ranking pipeline → Top 5-10 Microsoft Azure AI Search Benchmarks: - Vector-only: 43.8 NDCG@3 - Hybrid: 48.4 NDCG@3 (+10.5%) - Hybrid + Reranker: 60.1 NDCG@3 (+37.2%) ✅ Use When: Queries span sources, complexity varies 🆇 Don't Use: Latency-critical (<500ms SLA), simple retrieval 18 Production readiness 19 19 Don’ts 🆇 1. Vector-only search (use hybrid) 🆇 2. Ignore access controls (data leakage = lawsuit) 🆇 3. Overload context window (keep <50%) 🆇 4. Skip evaluation frameworks (doesn't scale) 🆇 5. Neglect data freshness (stale = wrong answers) Do’s ✅ 1. Use Hybrid Search (vector + BM25) as baseline ✅ 2. Implement metadata ﬁltering (security-critical) ✅ ﬁlter = {"department": "ﬁnance", "access_level": user.role} ✅ 3. Monitor retrieval quality (recall@k, NDCG) ✅ Tools: TruLens, LangSmith, DeepEval ✅ 4. Keep embeddings fresh (re-index on doc changes) ✅ 5. Evaluate systematically (not "vibes-based") Production Best Practices --- RAG Intro.pdf --- 1 Place for photo RAG Intro October 2025 2 Speaker Maksym Lypivskyi Head of Cloud Platforms & AI Director ● 9 years at Ciklum driving large-scale cloud and software delivery initiatives ● 3 years specializing in AI ● Core interest: making AI systems reliable, production-ready, and business-impactful 3 Agenda 01 02 03 Deﬁnition & Beneﬁts Use cases Limitations 4 The AI Adaptation Landscape Where Does RAG Fit in Your AI Strategy? ● Need fresh, proprietary knowledge ● Don't want to retrain models ● Cost-effective scaling Our focus today 5 What is RAG?
