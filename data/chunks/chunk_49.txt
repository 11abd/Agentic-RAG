candidates we are grabbing 100 candidates and then our rerunkin system try to understand what the best candidates for us and then provide us a result to the lm like 5 or 10 or maybe 3 of them and production readiness so basically what to do don't hybrid search is the best we discussed in addition about like a genetic search we discussed about the graph and where it's the most useful and what the databases you can utilize so based on your case based on what you need to achieve you can use any use any of that tools metadata filtering it's quite helpful especially when you need to have like metadata in general like a story of the metadata quite helpful especially when you need to have their sources seated like for example when you make the request and get not only some information from your documents in addition the citations from what documents that information is evaluation of your system embedding three indexing and evaluation of the system quite often because you are making their updates and you can continue improving your system so don't it's like opposite of the dos so just quite helpful for you to not forget what you should do for the production systems and thank you so we have one question in our chat does embedding library I use for for my rock must match embedding library I used for training my lm embedding library for training your lm can you maybe
