it will be very online and up to date. Is it? It's my newly developed GPT. Yep. Maybe a person can unmute and just say a few words what does it mean like newly developed GPT? Yes so it's my question so I just want to understand do I get it right about RACs? So if I have some LLAM whatever GPT or whatever and I don't want to retrain it I just want a new information like from the new database so it means that I can add this new shiny layer like RAC and then it's like chroma or whatever and it varies the data from this chroma before into the context window and just basically without retrain I will get all the all the information. Yes. Yes. Yes. Then it's fully correct. In a simple understanding maybe I just may clarify one point. Yes. So I believe the question was asked by Vasili so Vasili used like your I think you are oversimplifying it so in the first place you have to get your data into chroma so you have to get your data split it into chunks embedded, put it into chroma and then yes adding chroma and some RAC library on top of your GPT will work but you will get only your data you will not get all the new data available on the internet for that you would need to integrate with some other tools like internet search. Yes. I got it. Yes.
