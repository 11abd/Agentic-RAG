one pattern or approach for the rock systems in addition we can have this problem with the multi-hop reasoning with the connection and in the cases where we have like a bit more wake request and we need to identify the connection for that request in most cases rock traditional vector rock systems they are failing and in example that I provided and the problem that we need to have like connection built from our request that user asks like marketing budget compliance GDPR and basically Europe and this is the the connections and this is exactly one we need already to utilize graph system and graph rock in addition and it helps to increase reliability of our system together with LLM and quite often this is like a representation of the graph that we have and when we our user making the request it's just like getting some of the information from the request and learning the different connections and based on the connection that we have in the rock representation it can provide much better answer if we do not have like explicit information and one chunk of the information that we are grabbing from our vector system is not enough. main players for the graph rock solutions so now for Jay, Falcon, Tiger, Graph, Mamm Graph and ArangoDB mainly we are playing like with the now for Jay because you can easily like install it on the York laptop and I guess it's one of the most
