colleagues that we should potentially like add this as a part of our education because right now what what I see I don't see like exact evaluation in the session but potentially it's a part of some of the next sessions thank you why I said not only because preparation of the data it's not so easy as well without evaluation you just don't know whether you did good job at preparing your data or not so you can be building a system for like weeks or months but if you do not have any metrics to check its accuracy and performance then it was for nothing so as always human in the loop can save you from that but yes depends on the scalability of your system and all of that parameters yes I agree but in general what can I say it's not so easy still a question for the evaluation in general with with all of this alarm systems because they are like they are not like deterministic systems and still you need to identify the proper way how you can like even identify the top three that's a system should recall so different approaches in most the most the approaches like some another LLN utilized if you are not utilizing the people to to prepare the data so it's still not finalized question even for in general for the AI industry I would say --- pdf_text.txt --- --- Databases for GenAI.pdf --- 1 Place for photo
