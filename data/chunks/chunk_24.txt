latency. Some do some don'ts for the RAC system so quite often it's better to start from the simple approach even like from the simple base later on we will go a bit deeper on that. Use the metadata filtering in addition to the chunks most of the system provide possibility to add additional information and metadata like for example some category topic that's then it can be the part of your like filtering mechanism. Combining the vector and keyword search so hybrid approach and about that we will talk in our next session. Monitor the retrieval quality in addition to our like ingestion and our test we should prepare some pipeline that will double check the quality of our retrieval system. I will wait with the domain specific question so basically evaluation on that exact system that we are trying to build. To build like more reliable system not rely solely on the vector search so in addition you still have like your standard searches like keyword and we will discuss about some of the other approaches that's providing much better results when they work together as a hybrid approach and we're ranking approach as well. One of the biggest problems within the RAC this is the security and access control so it's quite complex to implement this sometimes but already some of the systems exist and we can just utilize them. Overload of the LM context so working on the balance of your chunks it shouldn't be quite
