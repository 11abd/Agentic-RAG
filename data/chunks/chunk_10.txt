So I'm a max right now at Siklom. I'm global head of cloud platforms and AI director. So I'm already nine years within Siklom. A long time ago I came here as a middle JavaScript engineer and went through the different stages of promotions and I was so lucky to have experience with different SDLC processes and stages that's right now I can jump much deeper not only into engineering topics in the developed topics, cloud topics and in a product topics as well. So from the start of chat GPT era I jumped to the AI direction as a self learner and I was amazed with the some of the experience that I got within the LLM and right now my main interest is to make a AI system as much reliable as it possible. That's why maybe you can find some of the topics that I did from the previous academies around the prompt engineering. This is where I started to adopt in LLM and try it to make them more reliable. And today we will go through like for this presentation we will go through three first topics. So we will focus on the definition and benefits. What we have from the rock some of the main use cases so from the practical life limitations and we'll cover a bit what tools you can use to speed up this process. So in general when we are talking about AI adaptation landscape so basically we have our base
