start in end prototyping because it's quite easy to start you just pipian style chroma and almost everything is working so minimal configuration and you are starting almost like immediately with that it still has quite good additional functionality like for example metadata filtering this is the additional information to your embeddings that you can provide as an example I've already mentioned for example like category of the document that you are feeding if you have like many of the documents and chunks for example in the metadata you can still additionally provide information about what exact document from from from from chunk is and different like multiple collection support when we are moving already like to the stage of potential MVP or already quite big production system then we need to have more reliable solution and here we can look in the direction of quadrant or for example like postgres with the pg vector extension and on the previous slide you you saw that quadrant not so good on 50 million vectors in terms of queries per second but when it's in the in the measure between like one to 10 million it's really quite quite fast and can handle a lot of the requests like for example for one million it's 626 queries per second and it's really quite fast and for that if you have that range of the vectors and you need to have quiet rapid embedding quadrant is a good choice in general but if
