handle a lot of the requests like for example for one million it's 626 queries per second and it's really quite fast and for that if you have that range of the vectors and you need to have quiet rapid embedding quadrant is a good choice in general but if you have like billions of vectors then this is the question about another type of the system and Milsvus and they have this embedding database in a cloud it calls Zleen it's already fully designed for quiet huge vector systems and it doesn't make sense to use this database for like much smaller systems if you have under 10 million vectors so do not recommend because that's that data and that's systems that going from the left to right it's then just harder like more complex to support setup and configure so that's why you are starting from the simplest one just for the rapid start and when your system is growing you are moving to the let's say next one and issue them just fulfill their purples and about like wrap patterns wrap patterns in addition to the embeddings because we discussed about the embedding vectorization it's not only one pattern or approach for the rock systems in addition we can have this problem with the multi-hop reasoning with the connection and in the cases where we have like a bit more wake request and we need to identify the connection for that request in most cases rock traditional
