patterns and mainly like query routing requests some of the the composition and self correction approaches in the agentech rock system so when the user make the requests what the latest on AI regulation so llem rotor detect like latest then we will utilize the tool road to web search so that's why I said like in general if we are saying that we add just additional tool like web search yes it's to some extent rock system and like when we talk about the query the composition so we have a compare our q3 to industry and predict q4 and first of all we have the the composition of that request that's agents our llem bricks like our q3 matrix then we need to find this information in our internal database or a vector system industry q3 benchmarks potentially we don't have this information it's publicly available then web search and q4 factors again goes to the internal DB but again it's can go to the web search as well and the search pattern its self correction so we first have a retrieval then we get in the documents then our agents based on some identified our like threshold measure this and if a score is like lower than our threshold then it can even like rewrite the query and then basically like a retry again this approach with the retrieval grade docs and it can be cycled few times this self correction and when it's it's to use
