biggest problems within the RAC this is the security and access control so it's quite complex to implement this sometimes but already some of the systems exist and we can just utilize them. Overload of the LM context so working on the balance of your chunks it shouldn't be quite big and for sure shouldn't be quite small because based on that your user of your system will get the result that's expected. Continuous update and do not skip evaluation framework. And here are not the three main chunking strategies but the systems that's or like libraries that you can utilize like for the scenarios of learning the main suggestion it's like LM chain because you can find a lot of the videos in YouTube it's quite extensive community around the LM chain and learning of the LM chain and that possibilities so basically you can utilize HROMA potentially sentence transformers or LAMA and some of the like key reasons it's you can like learn fundamentals and from the perspective or of risk-free like that stack that's I provided for the for the learning it's like fully open sourcing you can run just on your laptop but for sure you can if you do not use any data that shouldn't be sent to the models like chat GPT and stuff like that you can for sure utilize open EI or like Gemini embeddings for the for the easier approach and like as an MVP stage quite often we need just
