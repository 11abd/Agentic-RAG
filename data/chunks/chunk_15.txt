of the data to the LLM one of the big problem that's together with the data providing like water or noise that's just can navigate LLM when it use that like prompt information or text in the wrong direction so that's why quite often preparation of the of your data is quite important step as well then you have the step where you like preprocessing of the data like making like chunking a process because you can you can't just put all your 100 page documents to the vector database because it's probably huge and then LLM basically will get all of that 100 page documents as a prompt from the from the vector database so we have like different approaches how to split the information that comment with the with the documents and when we are talking about the documents the the information that's coming as an input can be like in many different formats because we are we are focusing mainly on the text formats but it can be audio it can be video it can be like images and different types like even chalice creep or python code basis then we after after the step when we split our data to the smaller pieces we are converting that smaller pieces to the numeric value and then that numeric value basically ingest to the vector database and we have a step of the retrieval it's one already our user of our system basically make the request and our
