collections per cluster - Distributed architecture with query node separation - Multiple distance metrics and index types (HNSW, IVF, DiskANN) Architecture & Performance - Embedded database (runs in-process with your application) - 112 QPS at 10M vectors - Python and JavaScript SDKs - Open-source (Apache 2.0 license) Memory Optimization: - In-memory and persistent storage modes - Optimized for datasets under 1M vectors - Simple distance functions (cosine, L2, inner product) Advanced Capabilities: - Zero-conﬁguration setup (pip install chromadb) - Metadata ﬁltering - Multiple collection support 10 Advanced RAG patterns 11 11 The Multi-Hop Reasoning Problem Complex Query: "What are the regulatory implications of our Q3 marketing strategy for the European market?" Traditional RAG fails Retrieves isolated chunks: 🆇 - "Q3 marketing strategy increased social media spend" 🆇 - "European market regulations overview" 🆇 - "GDPR compliance requirements" Problem: Can't connect the dots! Marketing → Budget → Compliance → GDPR → Europe This is where we need Graph RAG 12 12 GraphRAG Solution 13 13 The PDF Processing Problem 🆇 OCR → Errors with complex layouts 🆇 Layout detection → Misses table structures 🆇 Figure captioning → Expensive specialized models 🆇 Chunking → Loses visual context 🆇 Embed text only → No visual information Traditional RAG Pipeline for PDFs Result: 40-60% information loss on visual documents 14 14 ColPali Revolution Treat Pages as Images (No OCR!)
