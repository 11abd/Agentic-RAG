of the researchers already show that post-griest is quite good alternative to the specialized even database for the RAC so you can see that's for example like faster than pinecon and for sure like cheaper and still open source and for quadrants it can handle much more request per second but it's on a huge amount of the data so they tested this on the 50 million embeddings and this is where like quadrants start degrading with the speed of working so potentially you can use just that database that you use that you use to and you just need to add additional extension for the embeddings until you can continue playing with your lovely post-griest but still we have the databases for the vectorization and they still play their own game and for what use case for what systems they have the best results and it was already mentioned about like chroma today and chroma is quite good when you start in some of the prototyping it's less rare used in some big production systems but they already have their cloud roma I didn't try and still they have some like limitations so chroma database quite good when you start in end prototyping because it's quite easy to start you just pipian style chroma and almost everything is working so minimal configuration and you are starting almost like immediately with that it still has quite good additional functionality like for example metadata filtering this is the additional information to
