I just will not stop quite deeply on each of the slide just few words and what is the information important from that in addition to increase the quality of our rock systems and why I mentioned earlier that you shouldn't rely only on the vector search in addition you can utilize like best much search this is what bm25 it doesn't have semantic understanding but it's calculated the number of words that it finds like the same word that it's finding the different documents and can provide based on that statistic statistical calculation what the documents we should become and on the researchers when we have like a hybrid system approach in terms of the search vector plus this bm25 it increases accuracy for a bit more than 10 percentage and dcgs3 this is like tops we recalls basically tops we candidates that we saw earlier on the diagram and when we add the rerunter in addition it's even increased to 37.2 percentage rerunkin is additional layer that we add into the system and we are grabbing from our vector system or from our database a bit more results so we are we are grabbing instead of like 510 candidates we are grabbing 100 candidates and then our rerunkin system try to understand what the best candidates for us and then provide us a result to the lm like 5 or 10 or maybe 3 of them and production readiness so basically what to do don't hybrid search is
