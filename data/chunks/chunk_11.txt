What we have from the rock some of the main use cases so from the practical life limitations and we'll cover a bit what tools you can use to speed up this process. So in general when we are talking about AI adaptation landscape so basically we have our base model and we want to direct that base model in our for example like domain or our use case or our application. So we need to start guiding or providing or maybe tuning the LLM and you always go from the simplest way of the tuning of the LLM to more complex. In some of the like articles you can find that even prompt engineering this is some like tuning of the LLM because you are changing potential like behavior or narrowing direction of the LLM. And normally when you try to adopt LLM you are starting from that. The next stage and this is where we will focus mainly today for both of the sessions. It's retrieval augmented generation approach. This is where you already have some pipeline that helps you to add more extent and extend the knowledge and understanding of the LLM. The next stage it's like about the fine tuning mainly when you already need to adopt model in some way or like provide some way of the behavior of the model and for sure you can bring more knowledge to the model and the last one the biggest one where you have a combination of
