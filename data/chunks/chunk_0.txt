The Problem: Computers don't understand text meaning "machine learning algorithms" "ML techniques" "deep neural networks" Are these similar? How do we compute that? 6 How Similarity Search Works The Vector Search Process Documents → Embedding Model → Store vectors Doc 1: "Python tutorial" → [0.2, -0.4, 0.6, ...] → Store Doc 2: "Java programming" → [0.3, -0.5, 0.5, ...] → Store Doc 3: "Cooking recipes" → [-0.8, 0.9, -0.2, ...] → Store 1. INDEXING 2. SEARCHING User Query: "learn Python" → [0.21, -0.42, 0.58, ...] Compute distances to ALL stored vectors: - Distance to Doc 1: 0.03 ✓ (very close!) - Distance to Doc 2: 0.15 (somewhat close) - Distance to Doc 3: 0.91 (far away) Similarity Metrics - Cosine similarity: Angle between vectors (most common) - Euclidean distance: Straight-line distance - Dot product: Vector multiplication 7 Embedding Quality Matters 🏛 EVERLAW (Legal Discovery - 1.4M documents) https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard Model Provider MTEB Dims Price/1M stella_en_1.5B_v5 NovaSearch 71.54 1024-8192 Free (OSS) gemini-embedding-001 Google 68.32 3072 $0.15 text-embedding-3-large OpenAI 64.6 3072 $0.13 text-embedding-3-small OpenAI 62.3 1536 $0.02
