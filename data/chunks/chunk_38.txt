of how it fast and what is the how fast we are moving to improving all of these tools and systems the previous result was more than 200 seconds so the order of magnitude in terms of the speed increase for the vectorization in 10 times so that system much more like improved and we are going like on that speed and that changes with many models systems and tools in AI world because people experimenting companies putting a lot of effort in this race so to say and if we will talk a bit more about the databases exactly for the vectorization this is where I wanted to mention about the speed of changes as well because early I had this slide why we need to have like separate database for embeddings and that's like current databases like systems they have different algorithms they don't have everything that is needed for the embeddings that they quiet slow for the embeddings and it was but post-griest is moving with their extension they're moving in quite rapidly and catching up the speed question and especially amount of the operations basically like queries per second that they can handle and a lot of the researchers already show that post-griest is quite good alternative to the specialized even database for the RAC so you can see that's for example like faster than pinecon and for sure like cheaper and still open source and for quadrants it can handle much more request per second
