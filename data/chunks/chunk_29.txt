So give that question for the next session in case we will not answer.

Okay thank you and the last one. Can I put RAC to my newly developed GPT and it will be very online and up to date. Is it? It's my newly developed GPT. Yep. Maybe a person can unmute and just say a few words what does it mean like newly developed GPT? Yes so it's my question so I just want to understand do I get
