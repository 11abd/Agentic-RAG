embedding model that can understand what it sees so just embed the image and one of the interesting approach to solve this question for the last time it's quite like you let's say approach it's called poly library changes so they instead of like using OCR just for the describing what information exists on the PDF and then vectorize that information they have like vision language model for that and image representation just split to the patches and then that patches basically embed to the model and when we have the retrieval then we utilize that embedding model and still like visual language model to give the answer what we have from the images and this approach shows much better results in terms of like a rock system retrieval of the information from the system and it showed better result like 15% it's approximately then standard to three-wall system with the OCR that we have so to answer on the question quite often when we utilize the PDFs when we have a PDFs as documents we utilize the OCR for describing of that documents and then we store the information but this approach with the call poly showing quite interesting results and maybe it's something that will be used much more often in the future as the as a part of this type of rock systems but still mostly OCR approach used and a bit about like agentech rock because in AI right now everything changed to the agentech rock
