of the Nvidia and it's like golden middle middle data and why you can start when you are building your chunk your rock systems but then within the evaluation and testing you can find your exact the best size for the chunks and for your rock system just few takeaways so rock this is the system that helping us to provide to the LLM external knowledge at the query time chunking is quite critical so I will not repeat about the exact numbers hybrid search is quite often better than like only vector only search start or always simple not only for the learning when you are starting prototyping all or development you can start from simpler systems not utilizing from the start the enterprise grade database is about what we will talk later today and quite important part it's evaluation of your rock pipeline not only like building but systems that will help you to make the evaluation of the quality of your pipeline is quite important time for the questions to be honest we only have three questions so yeah I believe we have already answered that but anyway how do we decide the chunk size for documents how do we decide chunk size for document you're starting basically from that chunk size that's I provided when we have like 512 tokens and with the slide in window of 15 percentage and this is why you are starting and then based on your like further experiments quite often
