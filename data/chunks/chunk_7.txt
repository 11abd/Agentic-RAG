proprietary data and maintain multi‑tenant isolation . ● Long‑context reasoning: Databricks’ long‑context benchmark shows that Google’s Gemini 2.5 models can maintain consistent performance on RAG tasks up to two million tokens (longer than most models), whereas OpenAI’s GPT 5 models achieve state‑of‑the‑art accuracy up to 128k tokens . 13 13 Common Challenges ● Chunking & context windows: If chunks are poorly deﬁned, the retrieved information may miss critical context or include too much irrelevant text. Research by Analytics Vidhya notes that ﬁxed‑size chunking can break context while semantic‑based chunking preserves meaning but requires more compute . ● Model context length: Models can only ingest a ﬁnite number of tokens. Databricks’ benchmark observed that performance of LLMs like Llama‑3.1 and GPT‑4 starts to degrade when context windows exceed 32–64 k tokens . ● Retrieval quality: The quality of the vector database and retrieval algorithm determines recall. Missing relevant documents leads to hallucinated answers. ● Latency & cost: Large vector databases and embedding models can be expensive and introduce latency. 14 Don’ts 🆇 Rely solely on vector search 🆇 Ignore security and access controls 🆇 Overload the LLM context window 🆇 Neglect continuous updates 🆇 Skip evaluation frameworks Do’s ✅ Start simple, iterate based on metrics ✅ Use metadata ﬁltering (product, language, permissions) ✅ Combine vector + keyword search (hybrid approach) ✅ Monitor retrieval quality (recall@k, precision) ✅ Keep embeddings synchronized with documents ✅ Evaluate with domain-speciﬁc questions Do’s and don’ts for RAG 15 15 Three Main Chunking Strategies Scenario Stack Key
