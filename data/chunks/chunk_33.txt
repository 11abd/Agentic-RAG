we will reiterate a bit about the rug and we will go a bit more deeper in embedding, vectorization and other rug systems and possibilities and we should come to the state where we can even build quite big and reliable a rug system that will utilize rug. At this this slide I can skip. So we will focus on the foundation then more advanced rug patterns and some dosandons for production readiness and here we will cover even one of the questions that we had for the previous session. So on the foundation so what is in general like embeddings? So we have the problem with that example like words, machine learning algorithms, ML techniques and deep neural networks that's basically computer doesn't understand similarity of that words. Computers still understand only like numbers so it cannot help us to define just from the simple text are they similar or how to find. So basically like embeddings it's a transformation of the text to the numeric representation on the vector. So when we talk about like machine learning then for the for our embeddings we have like this representation of the numbers depends on the dimensions. So it's like on this exactly like image we have 500 36 dimensions so it's basically like graphs with the different points and in the dimension of this size we are we are putting the representation of this work on that graph. The same like for the ML algorithms, pizza and stuff like
