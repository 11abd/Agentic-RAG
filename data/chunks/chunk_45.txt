results and maybe it's something that will be used much more often in the future as the as a part of this type of rock systems but still mostly OCR approach used and a bit about like agentech rock because in AI right now everything changed to the agentech rock and for sure this is quite interesting and quite reliable approach so in the standard rock we have query and that query go into the embedding model then we query the embedding vector databases then vector databases provide to us like candidates like top candidates and then our query so our request plus candidates that our vector database provided goes to the llem llem then process all of that information that we put and then provide to our user the answer when we have the agentech rock we have type of like rotor agent llem and then within the two set that's available for that llem it's choose where to to roll that's request so to the rock search some external APIs or take in control of the over the world and then only providing the output message here we will have a bit more information on that so agentech patterns and mainly like query routing requests some of the the composition and self correction approaches in the agentech rock system so when the user make the requests what the latest on AI regulation so llem rotor detect like latest then we will utilize the tool road to web search
